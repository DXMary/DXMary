By day I am a Founder & Creative Director at [Webymar](https://www.webymar.com/) and by night I am working on some exciting projects and learning new things!! I aim to talk about all things tech, data privacy, coding, web development and cyber security.

<h4>I hope you will come along with me on this exciting journey!!
